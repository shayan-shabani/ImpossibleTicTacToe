# Impossible Tic-Tac-Toe
This impossible Tic-Tac-Toe game is designed to showcase the power of the minimax algorithm.


# Minimax Algorithm
The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used to determine the best move for a player in a two-player, zero-sum game. It works by constructing a game tree that represents all possible moves and their outcomes. The algorithm recursively evaluates the tree, alternating between maximizing and minimizing the potential payoffs. The goal is to maximize the player's own payoff while minimizing the opponent's potential payoff. The algorithm finds the optimal move by considering the highest value when the player is maximizing and the lowest value when the opponent is minimizing. It is used in turn-based games like chess, checkers, and in our case, tic-tac-toe.
